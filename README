QBX is a simple library implementing Quadrature By Expansion
algorithms for three-dimensional boundary integral methods. It
supplies functions intended to be used inside BEM codes, so some of
the interfaces are quite basic but the examples in ./tests/ show how
to use the codes in practice.

Installation instructions are given in the file INSTALL. If you have
downloaded the github distribution, you will need to set up the
automake system by running

./autogen.sh

in the root directory of the source code. You can then go through the
usual autotools configure process

./configure (options)

If you want to use code optimized with AVX extensions (this is
experimental but does give a performance improvement in the code where
it is in use) pass the compiler flag QBX_USE_AVX. For example:

CFLAGS="-O3 -g -DQBX_USE_AVX" ./configure ...

To compile the code:

make

and to install it:

make install

If you want to generate the documentation:

make doxygen-doc

installs the html documentation in doc/html
